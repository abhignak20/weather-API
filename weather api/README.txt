Internship Task-1: API Integration and Data Visualization

Project Title:
Weather Data Visualization using OpenWeatherMap API

Description:
This project demonstrates API integration and data visualization using Python.
The OpenWeatherMap public API is used to fetch real-time weather data for a given city.
The retrieved data is processed and visualized using Pandas and Matplotlib.

Features:
- Fetches live weather data using a public API
- Extracts temperature, humidity, and pressure
- Converts data into a structured DataFrame
- Visualizes weather metrics using a bar chart
- Saves the visualization as an image file

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Requests library (API calls)
- Pandas (data handling)
- Matplotlib (data visualization)
- OpenWeatherMap API

Files Included:
- weather_api.py : Python script for API integration and visualization
- weather_dashboard.png : Generated weather data graph
- README.txt : Project description and details

How to Run:
1. Install required libraries:
   pip install requests pandas matplotlib

2. Replace the API key in the script with your own OpenWeatherMap API key.

3. Run the Python script:
   python weather_api.py

4. The weather data graph will be displayed and saved as weather_dashboard.png.

Output:
A bar chart displaying temperature, humidity, and pressure for the selected city.

Conclusion:
This project successfully integrates a public API with Python and visualizes real-time data, fulfilling the internship task requirements.
